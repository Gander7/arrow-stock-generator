# Arrow Stock Generator
=================================
A script to easily generate stocked arrows in a shop.

## Getting Started
---------------------
1. Clone the repo
2. Create/update/tweak the config file for your setting/shop
3. Run the script inside the module folder 
```
cd modules
python core.py
```
or from the main folder with
```
python modules/core.py config.yaml
```
5. Copy Output and send to your player

NOTE: In Config there are some arrows with an X in their name. I use dndbeyond for most of my campaigns and the ones with an X are ones I haven't created in ddb yet.
